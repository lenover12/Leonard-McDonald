	- Using new Technology to prank my friends
		- Changed the narrators voice in the social game 'Fibbage' to my friends voice with a machine learning model I trained on his voice
	- Creating physical gifts
		- A calendar of myself in different humorous scenarios
		- A trading card game set of custom holographic cards in a booster pack related to my older brothers YouTube channel
	- Travelling (wow what a surprise)
		- Japan (18 month working holiday)

		- I wish to visit Europe next for a small trip
	- Video editing and producing interesting or funny videos (unreleased or gifts)
		- animation using LipSync technology based on phonemes and some hand drawings
	- I was born with the monkey DNA where I enjoy collecting/gathering things, so if I am left alone too long I will eventually start collecting something..

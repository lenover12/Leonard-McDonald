# Welcome to My GitHub! 👋

Hi, I'm Leonard McDonald 👨‍💻, I graduated in February 2024 and currently work as a software developer in a small company focused on C#, ASP.NET 9, nodejs, nHibernate, and deal with a lot of legacy code intermingled with newer solutions. I have a wide tech stack like most new developers finding their feet, so I will list only a few of them in my readme.

## 🌱 About Me

*[ this is a snippet from my resume, ask for an updated copy over at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonard-mcdonald)* 😉 *]*
Growing up I would always find ways to tweak my experience with software, whether its playing in the Windows registry or creating custom macros and scripts. While living abroad, surrounded by driven individuals chasing their dreams, I made a firm decision: when I return home, I will my passion. Driven by a love for problem-solving, I am wholeheartedly committed to crafting innovative solutions while carving out my career in the tech world.
- I graduated in 2024 with a Bachelors of IT from RMIT (via OUA)
- Love a bit of a janky setup to get my project outcome (not in my professional career)
- I am here to take what I learn and put it into something fun or meaningful
- Love User-Centered Design, Love efficiency
- Coles recently visualize their human/object detection that outlines customers in their security camera screens to scare theives, it's always existed but showing the customer means they're thinking smarter not harder, let's be like this.

### Hobbies

- Minecraft (Modding/Datapacks)
- Using new technology to prank friends
- Creating physical gifts (leaning on the creative & humorous side)
- Traveling (e.g., Japan for 18 months, South Korea for 9 months)
- Video editing

## 📂 Projects

### WhatEatsWell – Nutrition Information Brower Extension (November 2024 - Current)
This project is a continuation of another dropped project, previously started as a reactive web application that was intended and used to learn the MERN stack, and utilised OpenFoodFacts and FatSecret API's, and learning how to implement JWT and cookies. This project is now as simple as I can get it, as a browser extension that directly scrapes food/product nutrition information from Woolworths.com.au product and recipe pages, it stores user food choices locally in synced data, allows users to create meals from their food choices, and see the nutrition information of an entire meal calculated to serving sizes.

### Capstone Project - Product Tracking Reactive WebApp (Sem 4 2023)
Our group developed and deployed a reactive web app which scrapped retail websites for product price information. Users could add products, and the web app would track and chart price changes over time. (Grade: 92%)
- **Technologies:** ASP.NET, C#, JavaScript, React, Redux, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, Git, Trello
- **Role:** Full-stack developer
  - Developed API endpoints, frontend pages, and components.
  - Integrated database functionality using Entity Framework
  - Implemented secure user authentication via ASP.NET Identity
- Utilized Scrum and Agile methodologies
- Stakeholder Management - Conducted weekly client meetings and daily stand-ups

### Reactive Website Cataloguing CivitAI LoRA (Aug 2023)
Using NodeJS, Express, Axios, and JavaScript, this project connects to the CivitAI API to bypass an error in civitai.com’s search filter (at the time of creation). This project’s purpose is to correctly implement filtering of LoRA model searches, downloads, and categorization mechanisms as an easy-to-use website with one-click capability for downloading and sorting.

### Hobby Projects for Minecraft
**Fundraising: TeamTrees MC / TeamSeas MC (IaaS / McFunction) (Nov 2021)**
Created a custom server on Linux via CLI provisioned by Digital Ocean (IaaS), running MCFunction datapack code to orchestrate restrictions of a new game mode, running a public-facing Minecraft Server linked to the TeamTrees and TeamSeas Fundraiser pages.

**Live Lipsync:**
Remote console, Face mesh face landmark machine learning technology, Unix server hosting, and resource management all demonstrated in a python based live lip sync

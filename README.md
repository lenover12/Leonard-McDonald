# Welcome to My GitHub! 👋

Hi, I'm Leonard McDonald 👨‍💻, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Information Technology from RMIT (via OUA) in February 2024. I am passionate about software development and all aspects of tech, and I aspire to use new skills and technology in my personal projects. I am eagerly learning and using new technology all the time (most of which I have not uploaded to GitHub) but I miss having the opportunity to work within a team environment as I am currently a job seeker for software development.

## 🌱 About Me

*[ this is a snippet from my [resume](https://bucketofopportunity.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Leonard+McDonald+CV-.docx)* 😉 *]*
Growing up I would always find ways to tweak my experience with software, whether its playing in the Windows registry or creating custom macros and scripts. While living abroad, surrounded by driven individuals chasing their dreams, I made a firm decision: return home and pursue my passion. Driven by a love for problem-solving, I am wholeheartedly committed to crafting innovative solutions while carving out my career in the tech world with Software Engineering/ Full Stack Development.
- I graduated in 2024 with a Bachelors of IT from RMIT (via OUA)
- Eager to learn the latest technologies and integrate them into personal projects
- Enthusiastic about building user-friendly and efficient applications adhering to User-Centered Design
- Enjoy finding methods to integrate and automate technology into creative processes

### Hobbies

- Creating large-scale minigames & mechanics in Minecraft (Modding)
- Using new technology to prank friends (e.g., changing the narrator's voice in a social game called 'Fibbage' to sound like a friend's voice using a machine learning model I trained)
- Creating physical gifts (e.g., a humorous calendar of myself, custom trading card game set for my brother's YouTube channel)
- Traveling (e.g., Japan for 18 months, South Korea for 9 months)
- Video editing and producing videos (e.g., animation using lip-sync technology based on phonemes)

### WhatEatsWell – Nutrition Information Website (April 2024 - Current)
I have started work on a reactive web application using the MERN stack (I wanted to learn MongoDB) that utilises OpenFoodFacts and FatSecret API's allowing users to search for nutritional data on food items. Food data is formatted into a database structure that can be added and retrieved from MongoDB through API's endpoints. Users session and authentication is maintained through cookies and JWT. Check out the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lenover12/WhatEatsWell)

### Reactive Website Cataloguing CivitAI LoRA (Aug 2023)
Using NodeJS, Express, Axios, and JavaScript, this project connects to the CivitAI API to bypass an error in civitai.com’s search filter (at the time of creation). This project’s purpose is to correctly implement filtering of LoRA model searches, downloads, and categorization mechanisms as an easy-to-use website with one-click capability for downloading and sorting.

### Hobby Projects for Minecraft
**Fundraising: TeamTrees MC / TeamSeas MC (IaaS / McFunction) (Nov 2021)**
Created a custom server on Linux via CLI provisioned by Digital Ocean (IaaS), running MCFunction datapack code to orchestrate restrictions of a new game mode, running a public-facing Minecraft Server linked to the TeamTrees and TeamSeas Fundraiser pages.

**Live Lipsync:**
Remote console, Face mesh face landmark machine learning technology, Unix server hosting, and resource management all demonstrated in a python based live lip sync
